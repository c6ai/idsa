When it comes to data sharing, usage control plays a critical role in data sharing within an International Data Spaces (IDS) ecosystem. The IDS is a network of distributed data sharing systems that enables secure and trustworthy exchange of data among organizations, including those in different countries. However, with the growing volume and complexity of data, it becomes necessary to ensure that only authorized individuals and organizations can access and use the data. Usage control allows organizations to specify the conditions under which data can be accessed, processed, and shared. This includes enforcing policies that govern access rights, data usage, and data retention. By implementing usage control mechanisms, organizations can ensure that data is used in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, minimize the risk of data misuse, and maintain trust among all stakeholders in the IDS ecosystem.

- **MYDATA Control Technologies** MYDATA Control Technologies is a technical implementation of data sovereignty, which represents an essential component for informational self-determination. It is based on the IND2UCE framework for data usage control developed at Fraunhofer IESE. MYDATA Control Technologies implements data sovereignty by monitoring or intercepting security-relevant data flows. [MYDATA](https://www.mydata-control.de/)
